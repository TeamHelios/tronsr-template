Our plan is to be the best for Tron and the Community. We are wanting to have a self-sustaining system that will be around for a long time. We wanting to create a system that will help in running the servers without costing anybody to use them. I believe this is Tron’s overall goal for us to complete through the Tron Sr’s. Right now, we are just trying to get started and get our name and plan out there. We will want the community to help us along the way and we will reward them. Because we know there are millions of ideas out there and we want to hear all of them. This will keep Tron alive and cheap for all of us to use. We are build a Dapp that will help Tron in Decentralizing the world. Give the people back the power of their own data. Our First Dapp project is already in the works, this will benefit Tron and the whole community.
