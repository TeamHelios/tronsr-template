We are Team Helios, we are Tron Enthusiast we believe in a better decentralized world, and we want to help in any way we can. We want to give Tron and the Community the best ideas out there and let them spread around, to let the world know what are trying to accomplish. 
Our mission is simply, we want to Help build the best system out there for Tron to become everything we all know it to be. Our first step is to have several Nodes up and running to help Tron to have a faster more stable system. Secondly, we want to have a great community standing with us to make this happen. We need our supporters to help us make this happen so all can succeed and bring a better decentralized world. After we get voted in the top 27 then we can start working on building a complete Eco friendly sever system. That will have a solar powered and water cooling system to run the severs and the building.  This will be more efficient to run the servers, which will cost less and in return will give more back to the community. I personally would rather get away from the cloud servers and build our own network that way, when Tron does everything we are planning on, there wonâ€™t be anybody to stop us.
