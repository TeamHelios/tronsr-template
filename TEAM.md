## Founder

Name: [Jonathan French]
Role: I’m 32 years old, I have been working in the electrical field for 18 years. I ran an electrical company for 8 years. Being in the electrical field and running a company has not only given me a business mind set, it has taught me that nothing is freely given to you, so you must work hard for everything you create. That way you deserve it and it will help you fight harder to keep it. I learned about computer networking over the years and that has led me wanting to learn more about programming. I have built several node systems for Tron Test Net. I’m learning more and more every day. I am a Tron/Blockchain Enthusiast, I’m a true believer in what Tron will do for the world. So, I want to do my part and see the changes of the world. []
